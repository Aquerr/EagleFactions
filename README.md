# Eagle Factions

Current version: 0.10.1

## General
Eagle Faction is a factions/war plugin for SpongeForge. You can simply create factions and claim territories by using "power". Yes! Power! Just like in the original factions plugin made for Bukkit (and Spigot).

Eagle Factions will change your minecraft experience forever. We offer you a new gameplay with some extra cool features that will change your gameplay. Land protection while faction is offline, possiblity to destroy enemy factions, custom ranks, and many more.

Check our [Wiki](https://github.com/Aquerr/EagleFactions/wiki) to get to know how everything works.
