## General
Eagle Faction is a factions/war plugin for SpongeForge. You can simply create factions and claim territories by using "power". Yes! Power! Just like in the original factions plugin made for Bukkit (and then Spigot).

Our plugin offers you all you need for you factions style minecraft server. There are even some extra cool features like custom ranks, "pvp-leave blocker" and many more.
