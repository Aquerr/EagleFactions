## General
Eagle Faction is a factions/war plugin for SpongeForge. You can simply create factions and claim territories by using **power**. Yes! Power! Just like in the original factions plugin made for Bukkit (and Spigot).

Eagle Factions offers you some additional features which will allow you to adjust gamestyle on your Minecraft Server to your own preferences. Land protection while faction is offline, ability to attack someone's claim, Eagle's Feather are few of them.

Check our [Wiki](https://github.com/Aquerr/EagleFactions/wiki) to get to know how everything works.

**Feel free to send me your feedback!** :grin:
